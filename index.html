  <p>I LOVE WEB DEVELOPING AND I LOVE HOW WE CAN CREATE OUR OWN WEBSITE BUT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO IT BY GIVING IT TO A WEBSITE CREATOR WHICH CREATES A WEBSITE AND GIVES BUT IT IS NOT AS MUCH AS CREATING YOUR OWN WEBSITE IT IS VERY EASY LIKE EASY PEASY
    LEMON SQUEEZY THERE ARE MANY WEBSITES TO LEARN HTML AND CSS YOU CAN LEARN HTML FIRST BUT IF YOU WANT TO ADD YOUR WEBSITE A STYLISH LOOK YOU CAN GO TO LEARN CSS SO THERE ARE MANY COURSES TO LEARN FROM UDEMY AND MANY WEBSITES<br>

  <p>YEAH BLOCK PROGRAMMING FOR EXAMPLE:SCRATCH,MIT APP INVENTOR ETC. SCRATCH IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO CREATE ANIMATIONS AND VERY SIMPLE GAMES RECENTLY I WAS USING SCRATCH AND MIT APP INVENTOR SCRATCH FOR FUN AND ANIMATIONS AND MIT APP INVENTOR FOR
    DEVELOPING SIMPLE APPS SUCH AS A LIGHT SENSOR APP OR AN ACCEROLOMETER APPS ETC YOU CAN CREATE SOME APPS TOO AND DOWNLOAD<BR />IN IT IN MOBILE AND BELIVE ME IT IS AS EASY AS MUCH AS THAT OF A LEARNING TO WHEN YOU WERE A BABY</p>

  <h2>Science Experiments</h2>

  <p>
    I LOVE DOING SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS LIKE WHO DOESN'T LOVE DOING IT AND WHEN YOU DO IT IN ACCIDENT AND YOU CREATED AN EXPERIMENT BY YOURSELF IS LIKE THE BEST FEELING EVER AND WHEN YOU FIND THE REASON BEHIND IT IS VERY GOOD YOU GET THE KNOWLEDGE OF
    SCIENCE IN IT.
